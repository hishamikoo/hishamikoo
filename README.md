<b>Detecting Deepfake Audio Using AI</b>

- The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately detecting deepfake audio by analyzing and distinguishing between real and AI-generated audio clips. Using a dataset of over 2,100 audio samples, the model is trained on various audio features, including file size, spectral centroid mean, spectral bandwidth mean, RMS mean, zero-crossing rate mean, spectral contrast mean, pitch mean, pitch confidence mean, mel spectrogram mean, mel spectrogram variance, energy mean, and speech rate, to identify patterns and markers indicative of deepfake audio.

<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª Projects:</h2>

- <b>TaskGen (Django)</b>
  - TaskGen is a powerful and intuitive Django-based web application designed to create customizable task suites for developer interviews. Built to streamline the interview process, this app uses a pre-built knowledge base to generate coding tasks. It empowers users to create tailored suites of programming challenges that align with their unique requirements such as password protection and adjustable difficulty level.
